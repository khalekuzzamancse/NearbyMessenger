# Key Classes
## Client
- Each client will be identified via their IP address for different devices, and IP address + port within the same device,in the server side.
- After sending data, each client may close their socket and input/output stream. This ensures that data can be retrieved easily
  without mixing with previous data.
- When a client socket is closed, the device needs to send another connect request to the server. The server can then store
  the clientâ€™s active connection to reply back or forward messages. This is necessary because the server will fail to send data to a
  client whose socket or stream has been closed. 
- the client `username` is not accessible or known to the server,that is why server maintain it own representation to identify each client(ip or ip+port)
